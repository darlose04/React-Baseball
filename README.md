# React-Baseball

This is an app to detail MLB stats built with React. Currently, it uses a locally built API that I've manually uploaded csv files to, which can be found [here](https://github.com/darlose04/Baseball-API).

The API is also hosted on Heroku [here](https://baseballapi.herokuapp.com/).
